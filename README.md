Task 1:
Project: Iris Flower Classification
This project demonstrates building machine learning models for classifying Iris flowers into two species (Setosa,Virginica) based on their sepal and petal characteristics (length and width). We explore both scikit-learn and TensorFlow approaches.
Task 2:
Project: House Price Prediction
This project explores building machine learning models to predict house prices based on various features. We'll focus on two approaches:
scikit-learn: Using established machine learning algorithms with a focus on interpretability and ease of use.
TensorFlow:Implementing a neural network architecture for potentially higher accuracy but with more complexity.
